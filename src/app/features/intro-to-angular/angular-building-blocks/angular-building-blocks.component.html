<h2>Goals for this section</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Gain an introductory knowledge of the building blocks that make up an Angular
		application.
	</li>
	<li>
		Gain a sense of familiarity when you see the terms Module, Component, and
		Service.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>Angular Building Blocks</h1>
<app-body-content>
	<p>
		An Angular application is composed of several different types of building
		blocks. Each block serves a purpose and accomplishes different goals. You
		put these blocks together to build a
		<app-external-link href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn463786.aspx">
			Single Page Application </app-external-link>. If you are coming from an AngularJS background you will be familiar
		with
		most of these terms. Below I've listed the most common blocks as well as
		some uncommon ones.
	</p>
	<h3>Most Common</h3>
	<app-body-content>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Module</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Component</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Service</button>
	</app-body-content>
	<h3>Less Common</h3>
	<app-body-content>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Directive</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Pipe</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Guard</button>
	</app-body-content>
	<h3>From Typescript</h3>
	<app-body-content>
		<p>
			These are not specific to Angular but thought it would be important to
			list them since we will be using them often and can be generated from the
			Angular CLI.
		</p>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Class</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Enum</button>
		<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Interface</button>
	</app-body-content>
</app-body-content>

<h1>Dig Deeper: Modules</h1>
<app-body-content>
	<!-- Module Section -->
	<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Module</button>
	<p>
		An (Angular) Module, otherwise known as NgModule (en-gee-Module), is the
		basic organization block of angular. Modules glue your app together and give
		your app a virtual structure. Another useful way of thinking about modules
		is a container. For example, if you create a component (or whatever) you
		will then put the component inside a module. More on this later. Also be
		sure to not confuse NgModules with
		<app-external-link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html">Typescript Modules</app-external-link>
		or
		<app-external-link href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/modules">Javascript Modules</app-external-link>.
		That isn't to say Angular doesn't use js modules, it absolutely does! Js
		modules just aren't very important for this discussion. Let's take a look
		below at the CoreModule for Omg, It's Angular! application.
	</p>
	<app-frameless-image src="../../../../assets/building_blocks/core_module.jpg"></app-frameless-image>
	<p>
		Don't get caught up in all the details for modules right now. We will cover
		the inner workings of modules later. The key takeaway is Modules give us a
		way to organize our application, and this is done through the metadata you
		see above (ie. imports, exports, providers).
	</p>
	<h3>Module Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The term <b>NgModule</b> and <b>Module</b> are the same for the scope of an Angular discussion (aka this guide).
		</li>
		<li>Modules organize your application.</li>
		<li>Modules can be thought of as containers for other Angular blocks.</li>
	</ul>
</app-body-content>
<h1>Dig Deeper: Components</h1>
<app-body-content>
	<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Component</button>
	<p>
		Components, Components, Components. Components are the main building block of your angular application. They are the
		view. They are the alpha. They are the omega ... wait what?!? Okay seriously, components are one of the building
		blocks you will be working with the most. They contain your html, scss, and the code behind that drives the behavior
		of that html. A component can be made up of other components. So components are used to build pages as well as the
		individual parts that make up a page. Let's take a look at the <b>FramelessImageComponent</b> below!
	</p>
	<app-pro-tip>
		Angular uses a <b>Component Based Architecture</b> and does not technically fall under the <b>MVC</b> or <b>MV*</b>
		patterns; although parallels can be drawn. If you have not heard of the MVC pattern then no worries. It's not
		important to understand since Angular doesn't use it.
	</app-pro-tip>
	<app-frameless-image src="../../../../assets/building_blocks/component_files.png"></app-frameless-image>

	<p>
		To put things into perspective the image you see above is an angular component. So what is this component doing and
		why is it cool .. I mean powerful?
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The component is encapsulating all the parts needed to diplay an image in the center of the screen. Html,
			Typescript, CSS.
		</li>
		<li>The component is re-usable in any part of our application.</li>
		<li>
			The component Easily modifiable. If we want to update functionality or change the look we can modify the code in one
			place and our entire application will be updated.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The list above paints a pretty rosie picture, so I want to inject some questions into your head which we will
		slowly examine over the course of this guide.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do I manage all of these components?</li>
		<li>When do I create a new component versus writing the functionality into the current component?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember components can be nested (hierarchical) so you will always have a root (or page) component.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The <b>FramelessImageComponent</b> shown above isn't all that impressive but components can be as
		complex or simple as you need. Okay, let's take a quick look at the code.
	</p>

	<app-frameless-image src="../../../../assets/building_blocks/component_ts.jpg"></app-frameless-image>
	<app-frameless-image src="../../../../assets/building_blocks/component_html_scss.jpg"></app-frameless-image>

	<p>
		If you look at the .ts file above (the one with the @Component) and think "wow this looks familiar". Then you
		would be correct. Scroll back up and look at the Module code again. You will notice each of these building blocks are
		just classes with a decorator (ie @Component, @Module, ect). If you are interested in learning more:
		<app-external-link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html">Typescript
			Decorators</app-external-link>. Remember Angular is just a framework built using typescript. In other words, its
		just code that runs along side your code and gives you tools to create a Single Page Application.
	</p>
	<p>.. and again don't worry about absorbing everything right now. The takeaway here is that Components build your
		view.</p>

	<h3>Component Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Components are the primary building block for the UI and it's behavior.</li>
		<li>Components contain an html file, css file, and a typescript file.</li>
	</ul>
</app-body-content>

<h1>Dig Deeper: Services</h1>
<app-body-content>
	<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Service</button>
	<p>
		Last but not least, services. Services manage your business logic as well as giving you a mechanism to communicate
		between components. But what about Input/Output variables on components? Data binding (input/output) on components
		is useful for passing information in when the child component needs all or part of the model from the parent. However
		other situations arise where data binding will not get the job done. I generally default to services for my
		communication as this allows me to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create loosely coupled components.</li>
		<li>Communicate between adjacent components (one's that aren't parent/child).</li>
		<li>Persist data between components.</li>
		<li>Persist data between routes/pages.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When do I use Input/Output variables?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For a child component which will use/modify part of the parent data object.</li>
		<li>Events only used between parent child.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				For example, a click event fired by a component. Usually the only thing interested in a click event is the parent
				component. Trying
				to communicate a click event using a service would be unnecessarily complex.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Unfortunately this is one of those things where there are no hard and fast rules. At first you will be confused and
		unsure. In time the distinction will make more and more sense. We will touch on this again in the services section
		with some examples.
	</p>

	<p>
		I just want to make a quick point on <i>business logic</i> and <i>component logic</i>. What is business
		logic? Business logic is any logic/code which manipulates data or returns information in a way that does not relate
		to the UI. An example of business logic would be calculating the total cost of a pizza. An example of UI (component)
		logic is hide x dropdown when y is selected. It's a good practice to keep these seperate - here are some benefits.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Helps you share logic between componets.</li>
		<li>Helps you maintain <app-external-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single
				Responsibility</app-external-link>.
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I don't want to dig too deep into the single responsibility principal since you can find a plethora of
				information on the topic by googling.</li>
			<li>I can give a quick example of why it's important though.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Imagine you build a component which gives all the options for constructing a pizza.</li>
				<li>Within this component you have a bunch of different UI rules and branching logic to manage the UI.</li>
				<li>
					Also within this component you are calculating the cost of the pizza and within this calculate method you
					set some boolean values which manipulate the UI.
				</li>
				<li>Now your boss asks you, hey can we run these calculations over on y page?</li>
				<li>
					Or your boss says to you. Hey we didn't like our last design so we redesigned that page and we need to
					update the existing page with the latest design.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>How do services help in the above example?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Image that same component above but with a <b>PizzaService</b> class.</li>
				<li>This PizzaService class has a method on it called <b>Calculate(pizzaToCalculate: Pizza)</b>.</li>
				<li>Instead of your component worrying about the calculation it now just calls pizzaService.Calculate().</li>
				<li>
					Now when your boss comes to you with either of the above statements you don't have to worry. You can modify the
					page without worrying about breaking the calculation portion. Conversely you can update the calculation code
					without worrying about updating a specific page.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>
			More easily test your code; otherwise known as Unit Testing. Operative word here is Unit, your tests should only
			test one unit of code.
		</li>
		<li> More easily test your UI code; otherwise known as UI Testing.</li>
	</ul>
