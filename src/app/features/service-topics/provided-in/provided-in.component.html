<h1>@Injector({{ '{' }}providedIn: 'root'{{ '}' }})</h1>
<p>
  Huh? Why? When I first heard of the new providedIn attribute I had mixed
  feeling. To me the providers array makes perfect sense once I fully understood
  how DI works in Angular. When I first started I was thoroughly confused of
  course, but does providedIn make that clearer? Maybe. I hope so because it is
  now the default behavior for the CLI
</p>
<h1>So why the new attribute?</h1>
<p>
  One reason: <b>Tree Shaking.</b> The Angular team is obssessed with tree
  shaking at the moment (for good reason). What is tree shaking, you might ask?
  The simple explanation is: Tree shaking allows your application to deliver
  only the code which is absolutely needed. Tree shaking applies to more than
  just services but just as an example - if you have 200 singleton services but
  the user is on the home page and only needs 10 of those services, then a
  <i>tree shook</i>? application will only deliver those 10 services and will
  load the other 180 as they are needed.
</p>
<h1>How does providedIn help?</h1>
<p>
  It does this by enabling a service to be self contained. Examples are our
  friend so lets see the "old way" first. Below you can see we have a service
  called MyService and we are providing it in our Core Module, which is the
  normal way of providing a singleton service for our entire application.
</p>
<app-frameless-image
  [src]="imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.providers_array"
></app-frameless-image>
<p>
  The import statement is what tells our application "Hey I need this service"
  and in return that referenced code will be bundled wherever the import
  statement is located. Since this import statement is in our Core module the
  service will be bundled with our initial application load. As you can see
  below, our <b>my.service.ts</b> is coming along in the main.js bundle.
</p>
<app-frameless-image
  [src]="
    imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.network_tab_providers_array
  "
></app-frameless-image>
<p>
  You may be saying to yourself right now, "Who cares? Aren't we only saving a
  few KB?". Yes, and frankly most applications don't really need to care about
  this. Most services aren't very large in size and thus you aren't saving much
  by having the service load later. Much of the benefit will be with 3rd party
  libraries. Similar to our example above, let us pretend you are using Angular
  Material and you only use a few components. Angular Material may have 30
  "root" services, but you only need the ones which pertain to your components.
  Now only those 2 services you are using will be bundled with your application
  and the other 28 won't be, without the new providedIn attribute this wouldn't
  be possible. Fun right?
</p>
<app-framed-image
  [src]="imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.lazy_route"
>
  <div><b>Side Note:</b></div>
  A {{ ':bulb:' | emojify }} should be going off right about now if you ever
  wondered why a lazy loaded module needs to be setup as a string in your
  router.module and not as a hard reference with an import statement. If we used
  a hard reference then the lazy Module would be bundled in our main.js and
  wouldn't be lazy!
</app-framed-image>
<p>
  Now let's take a look at the new providedIn and examine the network tab again.
  The providedIn attribute located in the @Injectable decorator tells angular
  where to inject the service when it is referenced.
</p>
<app-frameless-image
  [src]="imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.providedIn_service"
></app-frameless-image>
<p>
  If you check the main.js in the network tab you will no longer find the
  my.service.ts anymore, because the service isn't referenced anywhere in our
  application. What happens if the service is referenced in a lazy loaded
  module?
</p>
<app-frameless-image
  [src]="imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.lazy_component"
></app-frameless-image>
<p>
  If you said the service will come down in the lazy module's bundle you would
  be correct.
</p>
<app-frameless-image
  [src]="imageService.images.service_topics.providedIn.lazy_module_network_tab"
></app-frameless-image>
<p>
  As you can see this allows us to provide a singleton service app wide in a
  lazy way. This is something that was not possible before providedIn since the
  providers[ ] forced us to create a hard reference in either our core or app
  module.

<h1>Module Only Services</h1>
<p>... need content</p>
<h1>Component Only Services</h1>
<p>... need content</p>
<h1>How does this work with Barrels?</h1>
<p>
  It doesn't. You can still technically group your services together in a
  barrel; however, as soon as that barrel is used in your application then all
  referenced files located in the barrel will be sent.
